# Chatsounds

Audio repo for [the chatsounds plugin](https://github.com/SpiralP/rust-classicube-chatsounds-plugin) for [ClassiCube](https://www.classicube.net/)~

Drag and drop sound files into https://github.com/NotAwesome2/chatsounds/upload/master/sounds/misc to add them into the game easily!

Please make sure the files are [small and in a commonly used audio format](https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds/blob/master/HOW%20TO%20ADD%20SOUNDS.txt#L13) before uploading.  
You can use the [Chatsounds Converter](https://carbonated-three-daphne.glitch.me/) to convert into small ogg files easily.
