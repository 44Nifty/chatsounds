# Chatsounds

Audio repo for [the chatsounds plugin](https://github.com/SpiralP/rust-classicube-chatsounds-plugin) for [ClassiCube](https://www.classicube.net/)~

## Adding sounds

Drag and drop sound files into https://github.com/NotAwesome2/chatsounds/upload/master/sounds/misc to add them into the game easily!  

It's better to categorize the sounds into folders.  To do this, edit the "misc" part of the above url to be the category name such as https://github.com/NotAwesome2/chatsounds/upload/master/sounds/minecraft if you were going to add a "enderman stare.ogg" sound.

Please make sure the files are [small and in a commonly used audio format](https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds/blob/master/HOW%20TO%20ADD%20SOUNDS.txt#L13) before uploading.

You can use the [Chatsounds Converter](https://chatsounds-converter.glitch.me) to convert into small ogg files easily.

More detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds/blob/master/HOW%20TO%20ADD%20SOUNDS.txt) and [here](https://github.com/PAC3-Server/chatsounds/blob/master/README.md).
